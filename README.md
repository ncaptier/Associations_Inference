# Associations_Inference

This repository proposes a new method to infer relevant associations within a set of features. It infers relevant predictors for several regression problems combining the Boruta method [1] and the Shapley values for feature importance [2]. Please refer to [BorutaShap.pdf](BorutaShap.pdf) for a brief description of this method. 

This repository also proposes a python implementation for the TIGRESS method which solves the same kind of problems.

## Experiments

In order to illustrate our method, we provide a jupyter notebook which applies it to the DREAM4 In silico size 100 multifactorial subchallenge. We compare the results with state-of-the-art methods such as TIGRESS [3] and GENIE3 [4].

## Data 

The training data sets and the gold standard data sets for the DREAM4 challenge were downloaded [here](http://dreamchallenges.org/project/dream4-in-silico-network-challenge/). You can find them in the folder [Size 100 multifactorial](https://github.com/ncaptier/Associations_Inference/tree/master/Size%20100%20multifactorial).

## Requirements

To run this algorithm as well as the jupyter notebook, one will need the following python packages:
* [boruta](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/boruta_py)
* joblib
* matplotlib.pyplot
* networkx
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* [shap](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)

## Examples

#### Boruta Shap method

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from algorithms.BorutaShap import Shap , BoShapNet

df = pd.read_csv('Size 100 multifactorial\DREAM4 training data\insilico_size100_1_multifactorial.tsv' , sep = '\t')
regressor = Shap(RandomForestRegressor())

BoShap = BoShapNet(regressor = regressor , responses = list(df.columns) , predictors = list(df.columns) , n_jobs = -1)
Boshap.fit(df)

print(Boshap.selections_)
```

#### TIGRESS method

```python
import pandas as pd
from algorithms.TIGRESS import TIGRESS

df = pd.read_csv('Size 100 multifactorial\DREAM4 training data\insilico_size100_1_multifactorial.tsv' , sep = '\t')

T = TIGRESS(responses = list(df.columns) , predictors = list(df.columns))
T.fit(df , normalize = True)

print(T.scores_)
```
